## For the community, by the community

**io.js** is a drop-in replacement for node.js and is compatible with nearly all the modules in**npm**.

**io.js** is a community driven open source project. It was started by the primary contributors to node.js but in the first few months attracted more active developers than the node.js project has had in its entire history.

## What do people want from io.js?

1.  Stability
2.  Transparency (Debugging and Tracing)
3.  Better Streams
4.  Long Term Support
5.  Embrace Ongoing Standards
6.  Localization

Concerns list compiled from the [roadmap](https://github.com/iojs/roadmap) project. Contributors welcome!

## Stability Policy

> We have the largest package ecosystem of any language, we can't break it.

*   We do not remove JS API.
*   [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
    *   Any API addition means a_minor_ version increment.
    *   Changes in V8's C++ API handled by[`nan`](https://github.com/rvagg/nan) mean a_minor_ version increment and a_major_ increment if they cannot.

From the [Roadmap](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/ROADMAP.md). Contributors welcome!

## NG (Next Generation)

*   A new platform for modern JavaScript Applications.
*   Will remain backward compatible indefinitely.
*   New APIs can be ES6/7 centric without breaking old modules and API.
*   Separates work on future API from improvements to the current platform.

NG discussions are ongoing in the[NG repo](https://github.com/iojs/ng).

## Debugging & Tracing

> Core should enable a massive and diverse ecosystem of debugging and tracing tools rather than endorse high level abstractions like`domains`.

*   Integrate with`trace_event` (New trace API for V8 & Chrome).
*   Document and evangelize a debugging ecosystem.
*   Unify system tracing endpoint (DTrace, LTTng, etc)

Work being lead by the[Tracing Working Group](https://github.com/iojs/tracing-wg). Contributors welcome!

## Streams

*   **Streams Working Group** has taken over`readable-stream`, which is now the official io.js`stream` module.
*   Fix all existing compatibility issues.
*   Simplify stream creation to avoid user error.
*   Explore[WHATWG Streams](https://github.com/whatwg/streams) interface and identify compatibility issues.
*   Improve stream performance.

Work being lead by the[Streams Working Group](https://github.com/iojs/readable-stream). Contributors welcome!

## Long Term Support

*   New release lines will ship with stable and supported dependencies.
*   Patch releases of older versions will be published for as long as people are actively contributing.
*   io.js will take responsibility for old versions of dependencies like V8 that appear in prior releases when their maintainers stop supporting them.

Summary from[Stability Policy](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/ROADMAP.md). Contributors welcome!

## Localization

*   Reduce impact of including`icu` (binary and memory footprint).
*   Foster a vibrant localization community.

*   Autonomous language communities (30+ registered so far)
*   Evangelism efforts to grow membership (160+ members so far)
*   Improve tooling for translating website, API docs, installers and slide decks.
